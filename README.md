## 🏔️ Welcome to Hollow Reach

Welcome to **Hollow Reach** — a **grim frontier campaign** where danger waits beyond the last firelight. This is a **[West Marches](https://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/78/grand-experiments-west-marches/)–style** game built around bold choices, brutal stakes, and player-driven adventure.

All sessions begin in the border town of **Wayfare**, the last safe outpost before the **wild, uncharted Reaches to the West**. What lies beyond is unknown — and that's the point.

There's no plot waiting for you. **You choose where to go, what to risk, and what to remember.** The DM builds what you chase. The story lives in what you survive.

> *Only the bold go past the tree line. Only the lucky come back.*

- ⚔️ **High Risk, High Reward** — Death is on the table. So is glory.
- 🗺️ **Open Table** — Join the sessions you can. No fixed party.
- 🎯 **Focused Sessions** — One clear goal. No shopping sprees. Just the mission.
- 📖 **Episodic Play, Serialized Story** — The world remembers what you do.

## 🧭 What Is the Reach?

**Reach** – a wide stretch of wild land.  
**Hollow** – a low valley or hidden basin.

**The Hollow Reach** is a rugged frontier of hills, ruins, and mist-choked forests west of Wayfare. Once shaped by the ancient Elder Races, it's now broken, buried — and waiting to be rediscovered.

Some say the roads shift. That old stones whisper. That nothing stays dead in the Reach.

This land holds:
- 🏛️ Forgotten ruins & cursed keeps
- 🕯️ Ghost-haunted valleys & sealed tombs
- 🔥 Things twisted by blood, spell, or sorrow

> *Wayfare — Lastlight, Hollow's Gate, Farwatch — stands at the edge of the known world.*

## 🌍 The World Beyond

The world is old — and most of it doesn't matter out here. For detailed information about the Elder Races, magic, monsters, and the factions that shape the wider world, see [Setting.md](Setting.md).

None of them matter in the Reach — until they do.

## ⚔️ How It Works

✅ **Player-Driven** – You choose the rumor or goal. The DM builds just that.

✅ **One Mission Per Session** – We skip town stuff. The moment we play, you're already out there.

✅ **Episodic Structure** – Each session is a closed arc. The world changes, but your group might not be the same next time.

✅ **Team-Level Progression** – If everyone survives and succeeds, the party levels and chooses rewards from the cookie jar. Fail or fall short? Maybe you make it back with scars—or not at all.

✅ **Fast and Deadly** – This is a hard world. You'll earn every mile.

**Wayfare is where rumors start.**  
**The Reaches are where stories are made.**  
**You write them together.**
