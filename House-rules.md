# Welcome to House Rules

_I don't favor variants or house rules as there are plenty of official rules to keep up with and they make the game unpredictable from table to table, but there are many rules in the game that are unclear and many start with "The DM decides…", putting the ruling squarely on the DM. However, there is often other guidance in the rules, so I try to rule as consistently and predictably as possible. What follows are a few genuine house rules, plus how I rule on ambiguous rules._

# 🎲 Be a Good Player

## Be a Hero  
Avoid cruel or evil characters. Anti-heroes are fine with approval, but not ideal for new players. Prioritize the party and the greater good.

## Be Kind  
“Roleplaying” isn’t an excuse for unkindness. In-character or out, be respectful.

## Engage: Listen, Watch, Speak  
Stay present and support each other’s stories. Speak in-character for roleplay and out-of-character for tactics. Encourage interaction between characters, not just with the DM.

## Roleplay in First Person  
Say “I do this,” not “my guy does this.” Voice acting is optional, but first-person adds immersion.

## Be on Time  
Arrive early, be ready, and have your character prepped before game time.

## Limit Language  
Keep profanity low and avoid real-world politics or religion at the table.

## Respect Theater of the Mind  
Don't move tokens without DM approval. Let narration lead. Some areas may be off-map — stay flexible and follow the DM’s cues to preserve immersion and continuity.

## Avoid Metagaming  
Play what your character knows. Share info character-to-character to reduce meta decisions and keep it fun.

## Know Your Character  
Understand your abilities and have go-to strategies. Spellcasters should review [chapter 10](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/spellcasting). Even simple characters benefit from prep.

## Play Efficiently  
Have a plan on your turn. Use AboveVTT tools to streamline rolls and actions. Ask for help if needed — I’m happy to assist with setup and shortcuts.

## ⚔️ Combat House Rules

**Cover:** (PHB only)

* One creature/obstacle = [Half Cover](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/basic-rules-2014/combat#Cover)
* Over half blocked = [Three-Quarters Cover](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/basic-rules-2014/combat#Cover)
* No line of sight = [Total Cover](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/basic-rules-2014/combat#Cover)
* Only the best cover applies

**Diagonals:**
[DMG optional rule](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2014/running-the-game#OptionalRuleDiagonals): first = 5 ft, second = 10 ft, alternating — prevents AoE distortion.

**Elevation:**
Use horizontal + half vertical (rounded down).

**Split Movement:**
You can always split movement, even between attacks or actions if the rules allow it.

**Flanking = Advantage:**
[DMG variant](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2014/running-the-game#OptionalRuleFlanking): you and an ally on opposite sides = **advantage**.

**Difficult Terrain:**
Costs double movement unless ignored. If it looks rough, ask.

**[Object Interactions](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/basic-rules-2014/combat#OtherActivityonYourTurn):**

* 1 free (draw, open, etc.)
* Drop = free
* 2nd = **Action** or 🛡️ *Bonus Action* (house rule)

**[Contests](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/basic-rules-2014/combat#ContestsinCombat) (Grapple/Shove or [other action options - Climb onto/ Disarm / Mark/ Overrun / Shove Aside/ Tumble](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2014/dungeon-masters-workshop#ActionOptions)):**

* Requires **Attack action**
* Can replace one attack
* 🛡️ *Bonus Action* allowed for **Fighter, Barbarian, Monk, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue**
* 🛡️ **Mark** - automatic for last target hit.

**Improvising an Action (Stunts & Other Cool Stuff)**
- Want to do something cinematic, clever, or parley with a foe? Awesome.  
- These are covered by the RAW [**Improvising an Action**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2014/combat#ImprovisingAnAction) rules, and can be used to achieve creative goals outside the standard actions.  
- Takes an **Action** and usually an **ability check**  
- ✅ *House Rule:* You may use a **Bonus Action** instead of an Action for most stunts to encourage creative play  
- On success: gain **advantage** on your next action **or** achieve the intended effect  
- On failure: suffer **disadvantage** or another fitting consequence  
> _E.g.: "Vault off the table and strike from above" → Acrobatics check → advantage if successful, fall prone if not._

**Initiative – Familiars, Summons & Mounts:**  
🛡️ *House rule:*
- Controlled creatures share your turn; actions may be interleaved.  
- Uncontrolled creatures act immediately after you.

[**Mounted Combat:**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2014/combat#MountedCombat)
🛡️ *House rule:* You share space and are effectively one size larger for reach/targeting.

[**Help Action:**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2014/combat#Help) 
Allowed for individual checks. Not valid for Initiative. Buffs like _guidance_ apply to only one character per initiative roll.

**Tiered Attacks:**
If your attack roll misses a creature (except a natural 1), you can deal damage to that creature equal to the ability modifier you used to make the attack roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the weapon, and the damage can be increased only by increasing the ability modifier. If your attack roll exceeds 15, but is less than the target's AC, you deal one half damage.

## 🧭 Exploration House Rules

**Theater of the Mind:**  
Don’t move tokens without letting the DM describe the scene (corners, doors, new map, et al). Let narration come first. Be ready to switch to non-map play when needed.

[**Skill Checks:**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2014/using-ability-scores#AbilityChecks) 
Players describe actions, and the DM narrates outcomes or calls for a check. Good narration can bypass rolling.

**Skills & Tools:**
-   Proficiency = add bonus
    
-   Two or more relevant proficiencies = roll with advantage

**Surprise and Hiding:** 
The first person to break line of sight with an enemy achieves [**surprise**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/basic-rules-2014/combat#Surprise) if their Dexterity (Stealth) check beats the enemy's Passive Perception. 

Otherwise, when hiding, a Stealth roll is only required **when the DM asks for it**. Visibility, noise, and distraction determine success.

Enemies hide too...

**Traps, Locks and Secrets:**
-   _Perception_ = notice something
    
-   _Investigation_ or _Arcana*_ = understand or figure it out
    
-   _Thieves’ Tools_ or _Arcana*_ = interact or disable  
    \* _Magic_

## 🔮 Spellcasting Clarifications

_(with house rules for ease and consistency)_

**Somatic & Material Components**
-   You need **a free hand** for **Somatic (S)** components.
    
-   If the spell also has a **Material (M)** component and you're using a **focus** or **component pouch**, the **same free hand** can perform both.
    
-   You **cannot** cast Somatic-only spells with a hand that's holding something **RAW** — **but we don't enforce this**.
    

> ✅ _House Rule:_ As long as you have a focus or pouch in hand, you're good — no juggling required.

**Component Pouches**
-   Work for **all casting classes**, ideal for multiclass characters.
    
-   Still require a **free hand**, but that hand handles both S and M components.
    

**Casting Multiple Spells per Turn**
-   **RAW:** If you cast a **bonus action spell**, you can only cast a **cantrip** with your action that turn.
    

> ❌ **House Rule:** We ignore this restriction. If you have the actions (e.g., Action, Bonus Action), **you can cast two leveled spells**.
> Whether you're a Sorcerer using _Quicken Spell_, or a Fighter/Eldritch Knight with _Action Surge_, go for it. If you built for it and spent the resources, you earned it.

---

## 🧪 Potions

**✅ _House Rule:_**

* Drinking a potion or administering a potion to a downed ally can be done as an **Action or Bonus Action**.

* Healing potions require **an Action or Bonus Action to recover** after consumption.
* If unconscious, the target recovers **as a Reaction**.

> *“The alchemical spark within a healing draught must be settled by will—or jump-started by crisis. The waking mind resists the flood—it must brace and swallow. But the silent soul drinks deep without struggle.”*
> — **Sarieth the Pale Alchemist**

---

## ❤️ Hit Points & Resting

> *“Hit points are a combination of actual physical durability, luck, divine favor, and combat skill. Only when hit points are nearly gone does a character start taking real, life-threatening wounds.”*
> — *Gary Gygax, Dungeon Masters Guide (1979)*

Hit points are not meat. They're energy, grit, luck, stamina — and they come back with time, breath, and resolve.

---

## 💤 Resting

* A [**Short Rest**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2014/adventuring#ShortRest) takes just **5 minutes** and automatically occurs at the end of an encounter. You can pause to bind wounds, focus your breath, or gather your will. Many abilities recharge on a short rest. You may also use your hit dice to heal allies. 
* [**Long Rests**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2014/adventuring#LongRest) take 8 hours and you regain **all** hit dice and abilities. Victories are reset to zero on a long rest. 

---

## 💪 Martial Surge

🛡️ *House Rule:*

Once per rest, a **Barbarian, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Ranger, or Rogue** may use an **Action or Bonus Action** to spend up to half their hit dice to heal.
They must become **incapacitated until the start of their next turn**, reflecting a moment of intense focus or recovery.
*Fighters still retain Second Wind separately.*

---

[**Readied Actions:**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2014/combat#Ready)  
Readied actions allow you to defer your turn, not just perform a single action.

As normal, you declare a trigger (e.g., “when an enemy enters my reach”).

If that trigger occurs, you may resume your turn, using any remaining actions, bonus actions, or movement you haven't yet spent.

This includes full use of features like Extra Attack, Two-Weapon Fighting, or Polearm Master.

🔄 If the trigger does not occur, you may instead choose to resume your turn immediately after any other creature finishes their turn, as long as it's before your next turn in initiative.

⚠️ Resuming your turn (via trigger or chosen timing) consumes your reaction.
If you never act, you retain your reaction and your turn is forfeit when your next one arrives, but you can choose to act with your remaining actions, _just before your next turn_.

🧠 Example:
You drop an enemy with your first attack. You then Ready to attack the next creature that enters your reach.
When it happens, you resume your turn — making your remaining Extra Attacks, bonus action, and movement, if desired.

Readied Actions can interrupt casters and force Concentration saves.

---

## 🏆 Triumphs

🛡️ *House Rule:*

**Achieving Triumphs**

Each time you overcome an encounter, you receive a triumph. Triumphs reset to zero on a long rest. At the start of an encounter, each player has a number of triumphs equal to the number of encounters you've overcome since your last long rest. 

**Combat** triumphs may be  killing a ravaging monster, stopping a ritual, recovering stolen goods, or rescuing a patron. 

A **social** triumph may be gaining information or influencing behavior that overcomes a social obstacle.

An **exploration** triumph might be solving a puzzle, overcoming a trap, locating an important secret, negotiating a hazard or completing a difficult gauntlet.

**Expending Triumphs**

On your turn, you may expend one or more available triumphs.

A triumph may be expended to acquire Inspiration, to regain a spell slot (one triumph per spell level), or to regain one use of a class feature.
