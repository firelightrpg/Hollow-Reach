:earth_africa: **THE WORLD**

The world is old, but its truth has been forgotten.

:moyai: **The Elder Races** – Elves, dwarves, and little people once ruled through ancient magic. Now they’re seen as twisted offshoots of man. Their legacies lie buried, stolen, or cursed.

:dna: **Magic** – Rare, dangerous, and often outlawed. Those who wield it are feared or burned.

:crossed_swords: **Monsters** – Not born. Made. Twisted things created through blood, spell, or madness. Most used to be people. Some still *look* like people.

:earth_africa: **Factions**:
- **The Eastern God-Kings**: Divine tyrants who rule through magic, slavery, and fear.
- **The Northern Clans**: Illiterate, proud, and magic-hating. Many are ruled by women.
- **The Central City-States**: Merchant oligarchies where coin talks louder than law.
- **The Woodlands**: Tribal, unknowable, and feared. Some say they eat the dead. Some say they speak with them.

:map: **THE LAND**

- **Andareth River** – Known to most as *the Blackfen*, this great waterway flows west to east, skirting the southern edge of the Frostmoor and cutting across the Wilderland on its way to the eastern sea. 

- **Frostmoor Range** – A vast and jagged spine stretching from the far north through the central west. Home to forgotten holds, cursed passes, and within its folds, the **Hollow Reach**.

- **Hollow Reach** – A rugged land of valleys, hills, and mist-covered lowlands, nestled between the east and west arms of the Frostmoor Range. Few chart it. Fewer return.

- **Blackmoon Woodland** – Also known as the *Wilderlands*, sweeping wilderness south of the Frostmoor and west of the City-States. It is only tamed where the Andareth cuts through it—between the merchant city of **Summercrest** and the frontier outpost of **Wayfare**.

- **Wayfare** – Also called *Hollow’s Gate*, *Lastlight*, or *Farwatch*, this is the last stronghold before the wilds of the Reach. It stands as both a sanctuary and a warning.
