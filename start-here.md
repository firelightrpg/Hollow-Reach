## :sunrise_over_mountains: Welcome to Hollow Reach

Welcome to **Hollow Reach** — a **grim frontier campaign** where danger waits beyond the last firelight. This is a **[West Marches](https://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/78/grand-experiments-west-marches/)–style** game built around bold choices, brutal stakes, and player-driven adventure.

All sessions begin in the border town of **Wayfare**, the last safe outpost before the **wild, uncharted Reaches to the West**. What lies beyond is unknown — and that’s the point.

There’s no plot waiting for you. **You choose where to go, what to risk, and what to remember.** The DM builds what you chase. The story lives in what you survive.

> *Only the bold go past the tree line. Only the lucky come back.*

- :crossed_swords: **High Risk, High Reward** — Death is on the table. So is glory.
- :map: **Open Table** — Join the sessions you can. No fixed party.
- :dart: **Focused Sessions** — One clear goal. No shopping sprees. Just the mission.
- :book: **Episodic Play, Serialized Story** — The world remembers what you do.

## :compass: What Is the Reach?

**Reach** – a wide stretch of wild land.  
**Hollow** – a low valley or hidden basin.

**The Hollow Reach** is a rugged frontier of hills, ruins, and mist-choked forests west of Wayfare. Once shaped by the ancient Elder Races, it's now broken, buried — and waiting to be rediscovered.

Some say the roads shift. That old stones whisper. That nothing stays dead in the Reach.

This land holds:
- :park: Forgotten ruins & cursed keeps
- :candle: Ghost-haunted valleys & sealed tombs
- :fire: Things twisted by blood, spell, or sorrow

> *Wayfare — Lastlight, Hollow’s Gate, Farwatch — stands at the edge of the known world.*

## :earth_africa: The World Beyond

The world is old — and most of it doesn’t matter out here.

:crossed_swords: **The Elder Races** — Elves, dwarves, and small folk once ruled the world. Now? They’re half-forgotten myths. Some say they were just twisted humans. Some say they still walk the Reach.

:dna: **Magic** — Feared, outlawed, and rare. Those who wield it are distrusted — or burned. Still, the bravest delve into secrets best left buried.

:skull: **Monsters** — Not born. Made. Twisted by curses, pacts, or grief. Some used to be human. Some still *look* human.

:shield: **Factions of the Old World**:
- **Eastern God-Kings** — Divine tyrants with fire and chains.
- **Northern Clans** — Illiterate, proud, ruled by war-mothers.
- **Merchant Cities** — Greedy, corrupt, barely civilized.
- **Southern Woodlands** — Tribal, feared, maybe even dead.

None of them matter in the Reach — until they do.

## :axe: How It Works

:white_check_mark: **Player-Driven** – You choose the rumor or goal. The DM builds just that.

:white_check_mark: **One Mission Per Session** – We skip town stuff. The moment we play, you're already out there.

:white_check_mark: **Episodic Structure** – Each session is a closed arc. The world changes, but your group might not be the same next time.

:white_check_mark: **Team-Level Progression** – If everyone survives and succeeds, the party levels and chooses rewards from the cookie jar. Fail or fall short? Maybe you make it back with scars—or not at all.

:white_check_mark: **Fast and Deadly** – This is a hard world. You’ll earn every mile.

**Wayfare is where rumors start.**  
**The Reaches are where stories are made.**  
**You write them together.**

## :date: How to Schedule a Game

### :date: Scheduling Basics
- Games start at **7 PM Mountain (6 Pacific / 8 Central / 9 Eastern) Saturday night** and run for 2–4 hours.  
- **Post in #adventure-signups** that you're interested in running a specific rumor from the #rumor-board-greenhorns  (must be confirmed at least **one week out**).
- If **3 or more players** express interest: the game is **on**.
- Up to **7 players** may join (even on game night).
- Players **8+** go on **standby**.
- On game night, **only 7 players** may participate (including any pulled from standby).

**Wait for Confirmation** – The DM will confirm and prepare the adventure in #scheduled-games. No confirmation = no game.

**Show Up Ready** – Be on time. Be prepared. You rise or fall *as a group*.

> *No story is written until you walk into the wilds.*
After the adventure, post in #after-action-reports.
