## 🧙 Hollow Reach – Character Creation

Welcome! Here's everything you need to get started in the campaign:

### 📘 Game System & Rules
- We use **2014 5th Edition Rules** (not the 2024 revision)
- You'll need a **D&D Beyond** account  

### 📚 Shared Content
I’ve shared the following official books:
- **[Player’s Handbook (2014)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/phb-2014)**  
- **[Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/tcoe)**  
- **[Xanathar’s Guide to Everything](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/xgte)**  
- **[Mordenkainen’s Monsters of the Multiverse](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/motm/fantastical-races)**  
- A handful of **legacy à la carte** options (e.g., SCAG backgrounds, older subclasses)

You may also use **any WotC 2014 books you personally own** provided the feature, race or subclass wasn't re-printed in one of the above 2014 books.

### 🛠️ Character Creation Guidelines
- Use the **Character Builder** on D&D Beyond
- **Point Buy** for ability scores  
- Choose **Starting Equipment or Starting Gold** (track your purchases!)  
- **Do not** manually add feats or features — use only what's available through the builder

### 🔍 Important Notes - _Please read!_
- For **classes**, select from the **2014 Core Rules**  (or **Artificer** from **Tasha's**)
- For **species**, use **2014 Core** or **Expanded (Mordenkainen's)**  
- For **Backgrounds**, choose from **Expanded** or **2014 Core Rules**
  - **Custom backgrounds are allowed and encouraged** as well as 2014 compatible. They allow you choose the flavor you want, along with the skills, tools or languages you want. 
- "**Legacy**" used to be a definition indicating a subclass or species was updated _in the current rules set_. However, **legacy** now covers most 2014 content. When in doubt, use the latest published version in 2014, usually **Mordenkainen's** for species or **Tasha's or Xanathar's** for subclasses.

_These will help you understand how to build a 2014 character._
