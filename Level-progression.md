# 🧭 Level Progression – Hollow Reach

🎓 XP is tracked **per character**. Each session = 1 XP. 

📊 Band Progression:
- 🟢 Greenhorn (Lv 1–4): 1 XP per level
- 🟠 Blooded (Lv 5–8): 2 XP per level
- 🔵 Veteran (Lv 9–12): 3 XP per level
- 🟣 Legend (Lv 13–16): 4 XP per level
- 🟡 Mythic (Lv 17–20): 5 XP per level 

🔓 Multiple Character Unlocks (optional):
- Reaching **Blooded** unlocks an additional **Greenhorn** character 
- Reaching **Veteran** unlocks an additional **Blooded** character 
- Reaching **Legend** unlocks an additional **Veteran** character 
- Reaching **Mythic** unlocks an additional **Legend** character 

📌 You may only bring **one character per session**. 

📈 Level up when your character reaches the total XP needed for the next level.

## 🔄 Re-Training Rules – Hollow Reach

You must bring a **legal character build** to each session. (See [Character-creation.md](Character-creation.md).)

🛠️ However, you may **retrain** certain choices **each time you gain a level**, including:
- Race or lineage
- Ability scores (including ASIs or point buy)
- Class, subclass, and multiclass choices
- Class feature options
- Feats

💡 You are **not locked in** to early decisions. If a choice no longer fits, change it when you level up.

🎯 The goal is to keep your character fun, viable, and true to your concept as it evolves.
