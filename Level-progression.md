## :arrows_counterclockwise: Re-Training Rules – Hollow Reach

You must bring a **legal character build** to each session. (See #player-setup-character-creation.)

:tools: However, you may **retrain** certain choices **each time you gain a level**, including:
- Race or lineage
- Ability scores (including ASIs or point buy)
- Class, subclass, and multiclass choices
- Class feature options
- Feats

:bulb: You are **not locked in** to early decisions. If a choice no longer fits, change it when you level up.

:dart: The goal is to keep your character fun, viable, and true to your concept as it evolves.
